So dear friends ✔️ I have decided to launch a crash course 🧲 to cover all the basics of MATLAB 😇. This course will be launched on this platform every Monday😊 I will quickly 💨 cover all the basics required.🌤️ 

This is ideally a binge-course for fast-tracking through MATLAB.🏃‍♀️🏃 All the blogs are 2-3 minutes read. 🎲

In case you want more advanced topics to be covered, please put them in the comment box below 👇 and I will cover them 💦 after the basics🎈🎈🎈

Before learning MATLAB, I would like to share a few words of caution.😵 MATLAB is neither free nor open. 😞 Unless you are a student ✍️ affiliated to any university 🏫 MATLAB might not be the best fit for you. However, there are good alternatives to MATLAB as mentioned [here](https://perso.crans.org/besson/matlab-clones.en.html).😎
Among these options, I would however advise two alternatives✋- Python (with scientific add-ons) and the Julia language. Julia is a better alternative 👌 to MATLAB with syntax very similar to it.🔆 You can read more about the benefits of Julia [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wonderbiz-technologies_julia-programming-language-the-rising-star-activity-6812722852954017793-NDEd).👏 
However one point of advantage 🪔 is that the syntax of MATLAB is very similar to that of GNU Octave 🌈, so in case you want to proceed your research there🥕, you might find this course of advantage.🌞

⭐Star this repo 🤩 and follow me for updates!🙂 👍 💥
