Friends, today is the last lecture of the series MATLAB MONDAYS. Today let us summarize whatever we have learnt till now throughout the course.

### Summary of MATLAB MONDAYS

- [Part 1](https://dev.to/aatmaj/matlab-mondays-crash-course-part-1-3o80) We had an introduction to what MATLAB is and where is it used. MATLAB stands for MATrix LABoratory. MATLAB is a scientific programming language used for simulations and data driven research. We also wrote our hello world code in this part. After that, we learnt about MATLAB variables. We can declare variables using the '=' sign, that is the assignment operator.

- [Part 2](https://dev.to/aatmaj/matlab-mondays-crash-course-part-2-2ol1) We learnt about some predefined functions in MATLAB like `rand()` `scatter()` and `min()`. MATLAB contains loads of other functions, whose documentation can be found out [here](https://in.mathworks.com/help/matlab/elementary-math.html?s_tid=CRUX_lftnav). After that we learnt control statements in MATLAB including the syntax for the while loop, for loop and if-else-elseif statements.

- [Part 3](https://dev.to/aatmaj/matlab-mondays-crash-course-part-3-414k) We studied row and column vectors in MATLAB. Sometimes, however we may require to create row or column vectors with large number of equidistant points. We learnt how to do that automatically in MATLAB. At the end we also learnt how to take the transpose of any matrix.

- [Part 4](https://dev.to/aatmaj/matlab-mondays-crash-course-part-4-2c43) We understood the syntax for the generation of matrices. In a similar way of making matrices, we can combine them together and fuse two matrices. Besides, there also exist inbuilt functions for matrix generation, which we covered in the part.

- [Part 5](https://dev.to/aatmaj/matlab-mondays-crash-course-part-5-pm6) We checked out how to operate on matrices in MATLAB. Then we had a look at matrix multiplications Matrix multiplication can be done easily by just multiplying the two together. Many times we need to find mean, mode or median of a vector. Such a statistical analysis of the data can be done easily in MATLAB using inbuilt functions.

- [Part 6](https://dev.to/aatmaj/matlab-mondays-crash-course-part-6-2c3c) This part was reserved for accessing vectors and matrices. Many times, we need to access the elements in middle of a vector or matrix. MATLAB provides easy methods to extract out the elements. Similarly we can easily access matrices.
